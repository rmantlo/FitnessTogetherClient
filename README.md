## Potential Version 2.0 upgrades

We look to add some exclusive user content in upcoming iterations of the Fitness Together web app. We will offer a paid tier site membership through Patreon. This will incorporate Google Pay, and will give the user exclusive access to personal trainer tips and videos. We will also work with nutritionists to offer exclusive nutritional plans based on your needs. We will look to partner with local gyms and boot camps to offer discounted memberships as well.
